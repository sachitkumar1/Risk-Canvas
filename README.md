# Risk-Canvas
Risk Canvas is a program that gives trading recommendations for a user's portfolio based on a calculated risk profile. It utilizes stock, ETF, and options data from Polygon.io's free API to compute the Beta, Sigma, MDD, Sharpe Ratio, and Value at Risk, and then generates a singular "risk value" for a user's portfolio. The reinforcement learning model then gives the user recommendations for specific changes to make to their portfolio. The program also gives users the ability to run a Monte Carlo simulation on their portfolio to view possible returns over the course of a year (252 trading days).
